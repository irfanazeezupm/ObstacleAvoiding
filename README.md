/*This project is about developing an obstacle avoiding robot with mapping feature*/

The inputs consist of two ultrasonic sensors, one for mapping and one for obstacle avoidance. Meanwhile, the outputs are L293D,four DC motors, and two servo motors, one for mapping and the other for obstacle avoidance. An Arduino Uno is in charge of the robotic's mapping and obstacle avoidance features. The control module serves as the central processing unit for the data collected from the ultrasonic sensors. The ultrasonic sensors identify the presence of an obstruction, calculate the distance, and transmit the data signal to the Arduino Uno for further analysis. After undergoing processing, the Arduino Uno transmits the processed data to the computer for the purpose of presenting the outcomes. The utilization of two servo motors allows for a complete 180-degree rotation of the sensors, hence creating a highly effective obstacle detection system with extensive sensing capabilities. The L293D motor driver enables exact manipulation of the four DC motors, providing seamless and precise motion on all four wheels. This adaptable technology is specifically intended for both obstacle detection and mapping applications. The power is effectively provided by a pair of lithium-ion batteries contained within safe dual-battery enclosures. The integration of this design improves the maneuvering and sensing capabilities of the robotic car, allowing it to be used for many applications, such as avoiding obstacles and creating maps.
